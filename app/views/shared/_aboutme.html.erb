      	Hey There! My name is Rick and I currently a Free Agent in the software development field.
        <br>
        <br>
      	I decided to use some free time to build out the website you are looking at now.  It's using <b>Materialize</b> on the front-end, <b>Ruby on Rails</b> on the back-end, and <b>Heroku</b> for hosting. I wanted something sleek and simple for my website so I went with something pretty design heavy. It includes all important information about me while showing off a few skills in web development.  I also included a link at the bottom to  my Resume in a professional PDF format. Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks!
